Python Program to Find Armstrong Number between an Interval:

We have already read the concept of Armstrong numbers in the previous program. Here, we print the Armstrong numbers within a specific given interval.
 
lower = int(input("Enter lower range: "))  
upper = int(input("Enter upper range: "))  
  
for num in range(lower,upper + 1):  
   sum = 0  
   temp = num  
   while temp > 0:  
       digit = temp % 10  
       sum += digit ** 3  
       temp //= 10  
       if num == sum:  
            print(num)  

This example shows all Armstrong numbers between 100 and 500.

Output:
125
153
216
370
371
407
